## Pricing

Pricing depends on the amount of time required to both prepare and deliver the workshop.

Bespoke workshops start from as little as £350, depending on the level of customisation and preparation time required. 

For a workshop where I don't need to do any preparation and can use existing materials, I generally budget using the Personal Tuition rate of £35 per hour (including travel time.)

Your requirements are likely to be somewhere on a scale so please email or call to discuss.
