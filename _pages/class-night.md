excerpt: 'A Photo Walk and Class in one; making beautiful images in challenging conditions. '




---
This 3 hour walking workshop takes in the buildings, canals and roadways of central Birmingham with an emphasis on tripods and long exposures. Warming up in the Jewellery Quarter, where beginners can get up to speed, we head over the Queensway to shoot the cars, then on to the canals of Brindley Place before ending at the new Centenary Square. If you're a complete novice I'll be on hand to show you how to shoot in Manual and use your tripod effectively. If you're an expert you can benefit from safety in numbers. Most people are somewhere inbetween.

*Tripods can be hired for £5.*


**Suitable for:** All photographers with cameras that can do long exposures.

**Accessibility:** Mostly pavements and canal towpaths, some steps. Fairly good accessibility.

**Frequency:** Weekday evening, monthly from Nov to Feb.

**Starting Point:** Outside [St Paul's Church](https://goo.gl/maps/RFtzhboDM2JeVQvw7), Jewellery Quarter. 

**Standard price:** £15
