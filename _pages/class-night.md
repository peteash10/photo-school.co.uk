excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

This 3 hour Night Walk takes in the buildings, canals and roadways of central Birmingham with an emphasis on tripods and long exposures. If you’re a complete novice Pete will be on hand to show you how to shoot in Manual and use your tripod effectively. If you’re an expert you can benefit from safety in numbers. 

*Tripods can be hired for £5.*

More a meander than an exercising walk, Photo Walks usually cover a mile in 90 minutes mixing in a bit of local history, myths, legends and tall stories. While not a formal workshop, I'm always on hand to offer advice and help you get the most out of your camera.

All cameras and levels of experience are welcome. I've even had people come without a camera for the experience of looking at the Birmingham in new ways.
