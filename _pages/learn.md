excerpt: 'Learning how to use your camera to make beautiful images can seem daunting. So many buttons and so much confusing jargon. Where to start?'

Over the years I’ve developed a technique for breaking it down to simple concepts which anyone can understand, and then building real knowledge about how they all fit together.

My goals, as a teacher, are to:

* Quickly get you taking control of the camera and taking better photos.
* Help you understand why certain settings do certain things.
* Make sure you’re not overwhelmed – I just teach what’s needed.
* Give you a foundation of basic knowledge, which you can build on later at your own pace.
