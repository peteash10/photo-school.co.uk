Over the years I’ve developed a technique for breaking photography down to simple concepts which anyone can understand, and then building real knowledge about how they all fit together.

My goals, as a teacher, are to:

* Quickly get you taking control of the camera and taking better photos.
* Help you understand why certain settings do certain things.
* Make sure you’re not overwhelmed – I just teach what’s needed.
* Give you a foundation of basic knowledge, which you can build on later at your own pace.

These are the learning events I have coming up. To be notified of new classes, [subscribe to the newsletter](/newsletter)

## Personal Tuition

If learning in a class doesn’t appeal to you or you’re after something quite specific, I can offer personal tuition. A chat in a cafe, a bespoke one-on-one class, an afternoon out taking photographs or something else that suits your needs.

Adobe's [Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html) is the industry standard for processing digital photographs but it has a steep learning curve.
