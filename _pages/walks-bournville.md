excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

A new walk around the picturesque garden suburb built from scratch by the Cadbury family to house their workers when they moved their factory from the Birmingham slums a century ago. The streets of Bournville is where I first learned photography, exploring this fascinating place with my camera. A return has been long overdue. 

**Suitable for:** All levels of photography and all cameras.

**Accessibility:** Mostly pavements and parks. Pretty good accessibility.

**Frequency:** Monthly-ish all year.

**Starting point:** [Bournville Community Hub](https://bournvillecommunityhub.wordpress.com/find-us/) on the parade of shops by the Green at 12pm.

Standard price: Â£10
