excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

More a meander than an exercising walk, we usually cover a mile in 90 minutes mixing in a bit of local history, myths, legends and tall stories. While not a formal workshop, I'm always on hand to offer advice and help you get the most out of your camera.

All cameras and levels of experience are welcome. I've even had people come without a camera for the experience of looking at the Birmingham in new ways.

## Digbeth

{% include figure image_path="https://i1.wp.com/www.photo-school.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/slider000011-1024x678.jpg" alt="Digbeth" %}

The classic two hour Digbeth walk weaving through the back streets, canals and hinterlands of this mysterious place. We take in (subject to the route) monolithic railway architecture, graffitied buildings, light industry, canals, artist studios, victorian urinals, repurposed factories, forgotten cathedrals, spectacular city views, neo-pagan stone circles and the mysterious terminating viaduct.

**Suitable for:** All levels of photography and all cameras.

**Accessibility:** Mostly pavements and canal towpaths. Pretty good accessibility.

**Frequency:** Monthly-ish all year.

**Starting point:** [Custard Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard_Factory) by the Green Man at 12pm.

Standard price: £10

## Spaghetti Junction

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/spagwalkers.jpg" alt="Spaghetti Junction" %}

Spaghetti Junction comprises two railway lines, two rivers, three canals and 13.5 miles of motorway. Underneath the monolithic flyovers is a unique landscape which the thousands of drivers who use it every day never see, from the calm of Salford Reservoir to the hidden forests under the concrete brutalism and noise of the flyover itself. The walk lasts 3 hours – bring a packed lunch and a flask. 

**Suitable for:** All levels of photography and all cameras.

**Accessibility:** Off-road. Not very accessible.

**Frequency:** Quarterly, for each season.

**Starting point:** [Powerleague 5-a-side](http://www.powerleague.co.uk/5-a-side/midlands/birmingham) car park. You can park there, get a 65/66/67 bus from Birmingham city centre or train to Aston station.

**Standard price:** £15

## One Year Photo Walk Pass

If you're going to attend at least three of my photo walks, this is for you. For **£35** you'll be issued with a Discount Code valid for one year, starting on the date of your chosing.

Needless to say, this makes a perfect gift!

It does come with some conditions, which I may update as loopholes reveal themselves:

* It's only valid for one person. If you want bring a friend they need to pay.
* It's not transferable. Your friend cannot use it in your place.
* The pass is valid for walks listed on this page only.
This is a very small operation and I will spot any monkey business which will see me cancel your pass and, more importantly, be very annoyed and upset.

**Is it worth it?**

Every walk I run is different. The weather, people, buildings, everything changes over time and I always feel I'm seeing the area afresh.

I also get bored and want to mix things up, trying new routes or checking out a new place I've heard about. While I'll often hit the same landmarks the journey between them will always be new.

In 2017, when I had a lot of other committments, I ran 10 walks. In January 2018 I had 14 walks scheduled through to December, with plans to develop new walks in Birmingham on top of them.
