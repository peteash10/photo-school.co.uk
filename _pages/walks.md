excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

More a meander than an exercising walk, Photo Walks usually cover a mile in 90 minutes mixing in a bit of local history, myths, legends and tall stories. While not a formal workshop, I'm always on hand to offer advice and help you get the most out of your camera.

All cameras and levels of experience are welcome. I've even had people come without a camera for the experience of looking at the Birmingham in new ways.

## Digbeth

[![](/assets/images/slider000011-1024x678.jpg)](/digbeth)

The classic two hour Digbeth walk weaving through the back streets, canals and hinterlands of this mysterious place. We take in (subject to the route) monolithic railway architecture, graffitied buildings, light industry, canals, artist studios, victorian urinals, repurposed factories, forgotten cathedrals, spectacular city views, neo-pagan stone circles and the mysterious terminating viaduct.

## Spaghetti Junction

Spaghetti Junction comprises two railway lines, two rivers, three canals and 13.5 miles of motorway. Underneath the monolithic flyovers is a unique landscape which the thousands of drivers who use it every day never see, from the calm of Salford Reservoir to the hidden forests under the concrete brutalism and noise of the flyover itself. The walk lasts 3 hours – bring a packed lunch and a flask.

## City at Night

[![](/assets/images/16138005618_9a8a0752b3_o-copy1.jpg)](/city-at-night)

This 3 hour Night Walk takes in the buildings, canals and roadways of central Birmingham with an emphasis on tripods and long exposures. If you’re a complete novice Pete will be on hand to show you how to shoot in Manual and use your tripod effectively. If you’re an expert you can benefit from safety in numbers.

## Jewellery Quarter

[![](/assets/images/jqsquare.jpg)](/jewellery-quarter)

A new walk, devised with the [Jewellery Quarter Townscape Heritage](https://jewelleryquarter.net/townscape-heritage/) project, that focusses on the network of streets between Warstone Lane and Graham Street. The first walks, during Birmingham Herigate Week, are free. Subsequent walks will be run by me for the usual cost.
