If learning in a class doesn’t appeal to you or you’re after something quite specific, I can offer personal tuition. Depending on your requirements and budget this could be a chat in a cafe, a bespoke one-on-one class or an afternoon out taking photographs. Or something else entirely!

Personal tuition often appeals to people who have figured out enough about their camera that the Beginners class isn’t necessary, and who need a bit of help filling in the gaps and developing their confidence.

**Basic tuition costs £35 per hour**, depending on location and requirements. A common package is £100 for three one hour sessions (which usually overrun, if I'm honest).

To arrange some tuition please email [info@photo-school.co.uk](mailto:info@photo-school.co.uk) with your requirements and phone number and Pete will get back to you.
