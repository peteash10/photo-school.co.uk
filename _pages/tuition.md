If learning in a class doesn’t appeal to you or you’re after something quite specific, I can offer personal tuition. A chat in a cafe, a bespoke one-on-one class, an afternoon out taking photographs or something else that suits your needs.

Personal tuition often appeals to people who have figured out enough about their camera that the Beginners class isn’t necessary, and who need a bit of help filling in the gaps and developing their confidence.

**Basic tuition costs £35 per hour**, depending on location and requirements. A common package is £100 for three one hour sessions.

To arrange some tuition please call 07775 690196, or email [pete@peteashton.com](mailto:pete@peteashton.com) with your requirements and I will get back to you.
