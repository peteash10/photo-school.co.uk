# Week 1

Today we're going to briefly look at photographic composition and how we can use it to guide the viewer through the photography. 

We'll then work on photographing different things at different scales. 

I will update this page with any notes and observations that come up during the day. 

## Composition Notes

The placement or arrangement of visual elements or ingredients in a work of art.

The term composition means 'putting together’, and can apply to any work of art that is arranged or put together using conscious thought.

### Emphasis and Storytelling

Telling the viewer what’s important. 

Guiding the eye.

### Technical Tricks

**Focus**

* Use a short depth of field (large aperture, low number eg *f*3.5) to highlight the subject from the background. 
* Whereas a large DoF (small aperture, high number eg *f* 16) says the fore, mid and background are all equal. 

**Motion**

* Show the difference in motion of different things by carefully slowing the shutter. 
* Freeze all motion by increasing the shutter speed. 

**Light**

* Use light to ‘spot’ the subject.
* Darken / Lighten the photo for emphasis.
* Use shadows to frame the subject.

### Aesthetic Tricks

**Thirds**

- Divide image into thirds and place objects of interest on the intersections.
- Always put the horizon on the lower or upper horizontal line to give the photo balance. 

**Colour**

- Use opposing colours to contrast subject and background.

### Shooting Tricks

**Angle**

* Change the angle you’re shooting from. 
* Move away from ‘boring’ angles.

**Prediction**

* Don’t chase the subject. 
* Observe and anticipate what might happen.
* Learn to read an environment.
* See Cartier-Bresson’s Decisive Moment

**Work the Scene**

* What you see with your eye might not make a good photo. 
* Try something, then iterate. 
* Change your approach until you're thinking like a photograph.
