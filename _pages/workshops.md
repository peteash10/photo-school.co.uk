A Photo School Workshop is usually a self-contained session lasting 3-6 hours.

I start with a class-based lesson introducing myself and setting the theme, followed by a group discussion. We then do a practical session, often outside, applying the techniques and ideas we’ve discussed. Finally, after a break, we return for a group review, putting everyone’s photos on the big screen, reflecting on what happened and setting future goals.

All workshops are tailored to your specific requirements and I am always open to ideas and new challenges.
