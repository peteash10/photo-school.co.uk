    Get to grips with the fundamentals of Adobe's Lightroom and process your photos to perfection.

---

[Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)* is the industry standard desktop application for processing photographs. Whereas Photoshop is about manipulating digital images of all kinds, Lightroom is purely about those produced with a camera. 

Lightroom is also a "workflow" application, designed to process and output batches of images quickly and efficiently. As such it's conceptually quite different to normal "load and save" programmes and can take some getting used to. 

This three hour workshop will outline in simple terms how to approach Lightroom. We will cover:

- The Lightroom workflow: importing, managing your library, processing images and exporting. 
- The power of non-destructive editing. 
- Introduction to all the varieties of Black and White.
- RAW, JPEG, etc. What format to use and how to judge their quality. 

This workshop will have you comfortable using Lightroom for basic tasks and able to learn more at your own pace.
