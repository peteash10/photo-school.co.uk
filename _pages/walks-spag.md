excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

---

Spaghetti Junction comprises two railway lines, two rivers, three canals and 13.5 miles of motorway. Underneath the monolithic flyovers is a unique landscape which the thousands of drivers who use it every day never see, from the calm of Salford Reservoir to the hidden forests under the concrete brutalism and noise of the flyover itself. The walk lasts 3 hours – bring a packed lunch and a flask. 


**Suitable for:** All levels of photography and all cameras.

**Accessibility:** Off-road. Not very accessible.

**Frequency:** Quarterly, for each season.

**Standard price:** £15
