excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

---

Spaghetti Junction comprises two railway lines, two rivers, three canals and 13.5 miles of motorway. Underneath the monolithic flyovers is a unique landscape which the thousands of drivers who use it every day never see, from the calm of Salford Reservoir to the hidden forests under the concrete brutalism and noise of the flyover itself. The walk lasts 3 hours – bring a packed lunch and a flask. 

More a meander than an exercising walk, Photo Walks usually cover a mile in 90 minutes mixing in a bit of local history, myths, legends and tall stories. While not a formal workshop, I'm always on hand to offer advice and help you get the most out of your camera.

All cameras and levels of experience are welcome. I've even had people come without a camera for the experience of looking at the Birmingham in new ways.
