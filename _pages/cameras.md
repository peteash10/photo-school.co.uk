## Which camera should you buy?

The choice of cameras is quite bewildering, which I why I get asked this question a lot from people wanting to do [my Beginners course](http://photo-school.co.uk/beginners-photography/). Ultimately it depends on what you want to achieve, how much you have to spend and what you're physically comfortable holding. And some of that you won't know until you've started using the camera. 

But there are so simple, broad-strokes guidelines to buying your first camera which I shall attempt to outline, based on having given this sort of advice to a number of different sorts of people.

## Phones and Compacts

I'll start with the sort of cameras people like me aren't supposed to recommend because they're not "professional", but it's important to stress that the camera on a high-end mobile phone is quite impressive these days. The latest Apple and Samsung phones also [incorporate a lot of computer processing](https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-why-its-a-whole-new-camera-ddf9780d714c), merging multiple images taken with two lenses, producing images that can surpass those taken with "proper" camera. While this might not be photography-as-we-know-it, if your ultimate aim is to create nice, clear images of things and to focus purely on your composition, a decent phone might well be enough.  

Compact cameras, which just have one shutter button and not many controls, I'm a little unsure about. You're paying for the same level of imaging technology as a camera-with-functions but without the functions, so it's probably worth upgrading a bit. Yes, they are small and easy to carry around, but so is your phone. I'd use the money you were going to spend on a compact and upgrade your phone instead. 

## Bridge cameras

The "bridge" camera is essentially the technology of a compact camera in a larger body with more buttons and dials and a bigger lens. This means it's nicer to hold, easier to control and can take a wider range of photos, but is ultimately as limited as a compact camera. 

On the plus side, they usually have the same sorts of controls as a DSLR (look for the big dial with M-A-S-P on the top) for a much lower price, so you can practice DSLR photography before committing to a real DSLR camera. This is what I did circa 2005 when I started thinking about photography but wasn't ready to commit. A year later I sold my Fujifilm bridge camera and bought a mid-range Nikon DSLR. 

In 2018 I'm not sure I'd recommend getting a new bridge camera as you can get a much better entry-level Nikon or Canon for the same sort of money. But if you have access to one, or see one second hand, it can be a good "training wheels" camera to play with. 

Ranges of bridge cameras to consider getting second hand would be Fuji Finepix and Lumix FZ. (Nikon Coolpix and Canon Powershot bridge cameras don't tend to have the DLSR controls, presumably because they'd rather you get a DSLR.) If a bridge works for you, great! If you get frustrated after a year you know you're serious and ready to move up.
