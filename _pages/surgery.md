To promote my classes, tuition and walks, I run occasional drop-in surgeries at public events to give you a taste of what I offer. 

You can ask me any questions about how your camera works or how to improve your photography and I will do my best to answer within 10 minutes. If we need more time, a class or tuition session will be recommended. 

If you are coming to the event specially and want to ensure a slot at a particular time, please feel free to [email me](http://photo-school.co.uk/contact/) in advance and I'll save you a space. 

Questions might include:

- How can I tell the camera where to focus? 
- Why is this photo better than that photo? 
- Why did this photo come out too dark?
- How can I make the background blurry?
- What lens should I buy next?
- How can you take photos in public without getting in trouble?
- What's a good camera for a beginner? 

Basically I'll have a go at whatever you throw at me.

For Autumn 2018 I will be running surgeries at [Stirchley Community Market](https://stirchleycommunitymarket.co.uk) featuring many local food and craft traders, so there's plenty to see and do. 

If you know of an event that I could run a surgery at, either for promotional purposes or comissioned for a fee, please do [get in touch](http://photo-school.co.uk/contact/).
