Photography classes and workshops can be tailored to your specific needs. On this page I've listed a few examples of packages I've delivered for groups, companies and cultural organisations. And if you have something else in mind I'm always interested in collaborating to develop new things.

## Photo Walks

A photography walk can offer a different way to explore an area or an event and add something simple and effective to festival programming. 

Bespoke walks are devised in collaboration with yourself and run in my tried and tested "slow down and pay attention" way.
