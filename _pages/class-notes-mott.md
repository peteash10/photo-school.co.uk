## Part 1: Basic Composition

All the following can be done with any camera, from a smartphone to a DLSR and everything inbetween. 

### Brightness

The camera's light meter will default to a "Goldilocks" brightness - not too dark, not too light. Boring! Override this by adjusting the Exposure Compensation, using the +/- button on your camera or tapping the screen on your phone. 

Use this to increase shadows or highlights to brings focus or add drama. Don't be grey! 

### Rule of Thirds

The simplest and most effective way to give your photo balance and focus.

Put the horizon on one of the horizontal lines, not in the middle. 

Put the subject of the photo on one of the intersection points to draw the eye to it.

Google "[rule of thirds](https://www.google.com/search?q=rule+of+thirds&tbm=isch)" for endless examples. 

### Frame and Crop

Photography is a much about what you exclude as include. There's never only one way to frame a subject. Try a variety of crops to change the context your subject is in. 

### Find the Lines

You've got your subject, but what's in the background? Look for simple lines and shapes which assist the subject, not detract from them. 

## Homework!

I would like you to send me the following:

- A photo where you've changed the brightness to sculpt the shadows. 
- A photo where you've used the Rule of Thirds to draw attention to a subject in a busy scene. 
- Two or more photos of the same subject which feel radically different due to your framing. 
- A portrait of a person where the background is as considered as the foreground. 

[Please upload your photos here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/JKBGRSpbQV2qGAoBYw5b) - if you have problems you can send them by some other means to pete@peteashton.com

I will build the second class around your photos so it's VERY IMPORTANT that you do your homework!
