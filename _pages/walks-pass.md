excerpt: 'Attend as many of my walks as you like for 12 months. Bargain!'


---

If you're going to attend at least **four** of [my photo walks](/walks), this is for you. For **£45** you'll be issued with a Discount Code valid for one year, starting on the date of your choosing.

Needless to say, this makes a perfect gift!

It does come with some conditions, which I may update as loopholes reveal themselves:

* It's only valid for one person. If you want bring a friend they need to pay.
* It's not transferable. Your friend cannot use it in your place.
* The pass is valid for events listed on the [Walks page](/walks) only.

This is a very small operation and I will spot any monkey business which will see me cancel your pass and, more importantly, be quite upset.

## Is it worth it?

Every walk I run is different, whether or not I follow the same route. The weather, people, buildings, everything changes over time and I always feel I'm seeing the area afresh.

I also get bored and want to mix things up, trying new routes or checking out a new place I've heard about. While I'll often hit the same landmarks, the journey between them will always be new.

In 2018 I ran 17 walks. For 2018 I have scheduled 14 walks through to July with more due in the Autumn.
