excerpt: 'Photo Walks are about slowing down and really looking at the details of the city while learning from being in a group.'

The classic two hour Digbeth walk weaving through the back streets, canals and hinterlands of this mysterious place. We take in (subject to the route) monolithic railway architecture, graffitied buildings, light industry, canals, artist studios, victorian urinals, repurposed factories, forgotten cathedrals, spectacular city views, neo-pagan stone circles and the mysterious terminating viaduct.


**Suitable for:** All levels of photography and all cameras.

**Accessibility:** Mostly pavements and canal towpaths. Pretty good accessibility.

**Frequency:** Monthly-ish all year.

**Starting point:** [Custard Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custard_Factory) by the Green Man at 12pm.

Standard price: Â£10
