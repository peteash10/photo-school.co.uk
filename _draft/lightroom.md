    Get to grips with the fundamentals of Adobe's Lightroom and process your photos to perfection.

---

[Lightroom Classic](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom-classic.html)* is the industry-standard desktop application for processing photographs. Whereas Photoshop is about manipulating digital images of all kinds, Lightroom is purely about those produced with a camera. 

This three hour workshop will outline in simple terms how to use Lightroom to make your pictures pop! 

We will cover:

- The Lightroom workflow: importing, managing your library, processing images and exporting. 
- Understanding non-destructive editing. 
- Introduction to all the varieties of Black and White.
- RAW, JPEG, etc. What format to use and how to judge their quality. 

This workshop will have you comfortable using Lightroom for basic tasks and able to learn more at your own pace.
