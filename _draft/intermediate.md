My [Beginners](/beginners-photography/) class is pitched as "everything I learned in my first year and in hindsight wondered why it took so long". It gets you over the initial hump and sets you up to teach yourself. 

These Intermediate classes could be described as "everything else, piece by piece". Photography as a discipline can never fully be mastered. We are always learning new things about the nature of light and how to capture it through a lens. 

Each class is 90 minutes long and covers a small selection of subjects so as not to overwhelm. There's plenty of space for questions and discussion to make sure the concepts are fully understood. 

There are currently four classes. They stand alone and can be taken in any order, individually or as a set. If they are popular I may add more. 

## Intermediate: Lenses and Focus

- What does something like "Nikon 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6G VR AF-P DX" actually mean?
- How does the lens affect the image? 
- Focus modes - what do they do and when should we use them?

## Intermediate: Measuring and Metering

- Exposure Values.
- Metering for correct exposure.
- What is White Balance, and when does it matter? 
- Bracketing and Continuous shooting.

## Intermediate: Composition

- Moving on from the Rule of Thirds
- Analysing the "great photographers". 
- Understanding *why* a photo works.
